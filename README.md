royalslider-playpause-button
============================

RoyalSlider module providing an overlay button to pause and re-start slide autoplay

Overview
--------

The RoyalSlider autoplay module allows a slideshow to be paused by hovering the mouse pointer over the slider.
The slideshow autoplay resumes when the pointer is moved away from the slider again.

This module supplements the autoplay behaviour by adding a small button which can be used to pause and then re-start
the autoplay. The button can be styled and positioned in the same way as other controls such as the navigation arrows
or fullscreen button.

Only the default skin is currently supported but making the necessary changes to the CSS and PNG
files for other skins should be trivial.

Usage
-----

Include the jquery.rs.playpause.js file alongside your existing RoyalSlider includes, or merge this file into an existing
minified version of the RoyalSlider JS file.

An example of using this module is provided in the demo directory.
